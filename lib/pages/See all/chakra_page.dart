When you feel stuck or rigid, spend some time with this sacral chakra practice to connect to your emotional center.\n    - Sit so your hips are higher than your knees and the area around your low back and hips can relax. Before you find stillness, rock your pelvis forward and backward a few times, loosening up the space around the sacral center.\n    - Floating right in the middle of your pelvic bowlâ€”midway between your navel and your pubic boneâ€”visualize a beautiful, vibrant setting sun as it lowers over the oceanâ€™s horizon line. The fiery orange light permeates your inner body, and reflects off the gentle waves of the water beneath it.\n    - As you breathe, begin to imagine your breath as the oceanâ€™s wavesâ€”inhalations pulling the waves to shore, and exhalations withdrawing the waves back into the sea. Although your body is still, your breath never stops moving, and you witness the suspension of the breath between rounds.\n    - As you meditate on the breath and the water element, picture any stuck emotional energy being washed over and through your system, clearing you from the inside out.',

Draw in courage, discipline, and confidence as you connect to your warrior nature.\n    - Begin by sitting comfortably, with your spine tall and relaxed. Before getting still, bring your hands onto your belly, and massage big circles in a clockwise motion. Not only will this movement aid in proper digestive fire, but it will also soften the belly, which can often get tense when feelings of unworthiness creep in.\n   - After rubbing 7â€“10 circles on your belly, release your hands onto your thighs and deepen your breath. On your exhalations, gently tone your abdominal muscles, and on your inhalations, let the belly get soft and full. This pattern will help to support a subtle Ujjayi breath, which will bring some natural heat to your system from the inside out.\n   - Visualize the element of fire burning away fear, inadequacy, and feelings of being trapped by your circumstances. You can picture the flame right behind your naval and blowing the smoke out through your nose with each breath cycle. By energetically purifying your abdominal area, you are also supporting your heartâ€™s desires, helping you to take action from a place of strength and self-confidence.',

By regularly meditating on your third eye, you can more easily break through your limiting thought patterns, and cultivate greater wisdom and imagination.\n   - Close your eyes while sitting or lying comfortably. Turn your gaze up toward the space between your brows, bringing energy to the third eye point. While the physical eyes look outward, the third eye is said to look inward. As you bring your attention to this energetic point, envision the color indigo or deep, royal blue.\n    - Try to keep the skin around your eyes soft and relaxed. Begin to draw your awareness back from the forehead toward the mid-brain. Consider the consciousness that sees through your eyes, and see if you can catch glimpses of this inner light between your ears. As thoughts come and go, let them pass like clouds, and return the awareness to the midpoint of your brain. If it helps, press the tip of your tongue to the upper palate to stimulate the Ajna chakra from underneath it.\n   - Keep your breath smooth and steady as you breathe in and out through your nose.',

Imagine your head floating like a water lily at the top of your spine. Soften your neck, jaw, eyes, and brow. You might even tap on the crown of your head a few times to stimulate and awaken the crown chakra point.\n    - At the top of your head, imagine an invisible lotus flower with a thousand petals. Invite it to open up, so that you might know yourself and the Truth more fully.\n    - Imagine a column of purple light extending from the center of the on your head up into the sky. As you inhale, the purple light moves down and into your body, and as you exhale, it moves up into the sky. See the light moving in as Divine consciousness filling you up with every breath. Each exhale becomes an offering back to Source.\n   - When it feels natural, let your awareness settle on the point at the center of the imaginary lotus, offering thanks to your higher self for revealing itself to you.',
